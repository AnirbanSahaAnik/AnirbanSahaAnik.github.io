## Research Interests
My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with interests in **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **health misinformation detection**, and **fact-grounded communication**. I aim to build context-aware, interpretable, and socially responsible AI systems for critical domains like public health and crisis response. My goal is to design adaptive, human-aligned models that support decision-making, trust, and effective communication.
