## Welcome

I'm **Anirban Saha Anik**, a graduate researcher in Data Science at the University of North Texas (UNT). I currently work at the [Human-Centered Computing Lab](https://lingzihong.github.io/index.html) under the supervision of Dr. Lingzi Hong.

My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), crisis informatics, and trustworthy AI. I focus on building systems that enhance public communication through Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in high-stakes domains like health misinformation and crisis response.

### Research Interests
- Large Language Models (LLMs): LLaMA, Mistral, GPT
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Health and Crisis Misinformation Detection
- Evidence-based and Personalized Counterspeech Generation
- Responsible AI and Human-Centered NLP
