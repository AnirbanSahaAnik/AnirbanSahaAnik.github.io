## Welcome

I’m **Anirban Saha Anik**, a graduate researcher in Data Science at the **University of North Texas (UNT)**.  
I work at the [Human-Centered Computing Lab](https://lingzihong.github.io/index.html), supervised by **Dr. Lingzi Hong**.  

My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **crisis informatics**, and **trustworthy AI**. I develop methods to enhance public communication through **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly in **health misinformation** and **crisis response** contexts.

### Research Interests

- Large Language Models (LLaMA, Mistral, GPT)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Health & Crisis Misinformation Detection  
- Evidence-Based & Personalized Counterspeech  
- Responsible & Human-Centered AI
