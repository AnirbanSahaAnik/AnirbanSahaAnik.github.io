**Abstract**  
Outcome-Based Education (OBE) has become a widely adopted pedagogical framework, but understanding students' perspectives on its effectiveness remains crucial for continuous improvement. This paper leverages transformer-based natural language processing models to analyze student feedback and sentiments regarding OBE implementation.

We apply state-of-the-art transformer models to process and categorize student responses, identifying key themes, sentiments, and areas of concern. Our analysis provides actionable insights for educators and administrators to enhance OBE practices.
