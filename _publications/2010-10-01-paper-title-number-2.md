**Abstract**  
Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and offer less control over final outputs.

To address these challenges, we propose a **Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework** to generate counterspeech against health misinformation. This framework leverages multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach integrates both static and dynamic evidence sources, ensuring that the generated counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date.

The method outperforms baseline approaches across multiple evaluation criteria, including **politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy**. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of each agent, and human evaluations indicate a strong preference for the refined responses generated by our pipeline.
