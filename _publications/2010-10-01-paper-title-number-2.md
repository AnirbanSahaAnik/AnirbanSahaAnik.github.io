**Abstract**  
Large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown strong potential in generating counterspeech against misinformation. However, existing methods often rely on limited evidence and offer minimal control over generated responses.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a **Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework** for generating evidence-based counterspeech targeting health misinformation. This framework coordinates multiple LLM agents responsible for evidence retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. By combining static knowledge with dynamic web-based sources, the system ensures relevance, factuality, and timeliness.

Our approach outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including **politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy**. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each agent, while human evaluations show a consistent preference for the refined outputs generated by our system.
